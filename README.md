Sustainable energy &amp; agrivoltaics research: LASSO competition (UW MARS), World Agrivoltaics conference paper, plus smart building solutions with BIPV &amp; IoT. This repo hosts drafts and docs advancing renewable innovation.

1. **Agrivoltaics in India: A Case Study for Global Sustainable Development**  
   (accepted at World Agrivoltaics Conference, 2025)
   Explores how integrating soilless agriculture with photovoltaic (PV) systems can address India’s food and energy challenges. Emphasizes policy frameworks, digital technologies (IoT, data analytics), and the synergy between renewable energy and sustainable farming to      enhance rural livelihoods and resource efficiency.
   
3. **Smart Building Technologies Integrating IoT and BIPV for Energy-Positive Construction**  
   Examines advanced solar integration (BIPV, Perovskite cells, DSSCs) and IoT-driven building automation for energy-positive buildings. Highlights design considerations, green building standards (LEED, BREEAM), and real-world examples—like The Edge—to show how AI- 
   enabled monitoring and predictive maintenance can drastically reduce a structure’s environmental footprint
