1. **Agrivoltaics in India: A Case Study for Global Sustainable Development**  
   (accepted at World Agrivoltaics Conference, 2025)
   Explores how integrating soilless agriculture with photovoltaic (PV) systems can address India’s food and energy challenges. Emphasizes policy frameworks, digital technologies (IoT, data analytics), and the synergy between renewable energy and sustainable farming to      enhance rural livelihoods and resource efficiency.
   
2. **Smart Building Technologies Integrating IoT and BIPV for Energy-Positive Construction**  
   Examines advanced solar integration (BIPV, Perovskite cells, DSSCs) and IoT-driven building automation for energy-positive buildings. Highlights design considerations, green building standards (LEED, BREEAM), and real-world examples—like The Edge—to show how AI- 
   enabled monitoring and predictive maintenance can drastically reduce a structure’s environmental footprint

3. **UW MARS LASSO Agrivoltaics Competition**
   A collaborative research project with the University of Wisconsin Marshfield Agricultural Research Station to integrate solar PV arrays alongside cattle grazing. This initiative aims to measure the feasibility, land management benefits, and cattle welfare impacts of      agrivoltaics, paving the way for scalable, sustainable energy solutions in agriculture.
